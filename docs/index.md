# SparklingPandas

SparklingPandas aims to make it easy to use the distributed computing power
of PySpark to scale your data analysis with Pandas. SparklingPandas builds on
Spark's DataFrame class to give you a polished, pythonic, and Pandas-like API.

#Requirements

The primary requirement of SparklingPandas is that you have a recent (v1.4
currently) version of Spark installed - <http://spark.apache.org> and Python
2.7.

# Using

Make sure you have the SPARK_HOME environment variable set correctly, as
SparklingPandas uses this for including the PySpark libraries

Other than that you can install SparklingPandas with pip and just import it.

# State
This is in early development. Feedback is taken seriously and is seriously appreciated.
As you can tell, us SparklingPandas are a pretty serious bunch.
