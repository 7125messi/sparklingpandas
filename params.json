You can find some slides in the slides/ directory\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe primary requirement of SparklingPandas is that you have a recent (v1.0-SNAPSHOT currently) version of Spark installed - <http://spark.apache.org>\r\n\r\nUsing\r\n=========\r\n\r\nMake sure you have the SPARK_HOME enviroment variable set correctly, as SparklingPandas uses this for including the PySpark libraries\r\n\r\nOther than that you can install SparklingPandas with pip and just import it. The primary unit of SparklingPandas is a PRDD (Pandas Resillent Distributed Data Set)\r\n\r\nState\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThis is in early development and should not be considered usable.\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThere isn't really a mailing list, but if you want to use please feel free to e-mail me ( holden@pigscanfly.ca ) with any questions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
