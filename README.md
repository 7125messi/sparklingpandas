# POPS

Pandas On PySpark(POPS)

## Documentation

None (right now). You can find some slides in the slides/ directory

## Requirements

The primary requirement of POPS is that you have a recent (v1.0-SNAPSHOT currently) version of Spark installed - <http://spark.apache.org>

## Using

Make sure you have the SPARK_HOME enviroment variable set correctly, as POPS uses this for including the PySpark libraries

Other than that you can install POPS with pip and just import it. The primary unit of POPS is a PRDD (Pandas Resillent Distributed Data Set)

## State

This is in early development and should not be considered usable.

## Support

There isn't really a mailing list, but if you want to use please feel free to e-mail me ( holden@pigscanfly.ca ) with any questions.
